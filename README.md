# Deep Learning - Sentiment Analysis

The objective of this assignment is to construct a model for sentiment analysis using recurrent neural networks with word embeddings to accurately predict the application review score based on user reviews on the Google Play Store.<br><br>
To learn dispersed representations of both review contents and ratings, a mix of gated recurrent units and a recurrent neural network is adopted. These representations are then loaded into a machine learning model for sentiment classification. The approach will then be evaluated using data gathered from the Google Play Store of a single application. Each review is rated from 1 to 5 and categorised accordingly.
